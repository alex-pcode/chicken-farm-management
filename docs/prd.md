# Chicken Manager Structural Refactoring PRD

## Executive Summary

**Chicken Manager transforms from a working prototype to a maintainable, scalable codebase through comprehensive structural improvements.** Instead of continuing with technical debt and scattered patterns, we'll establish a solid architectural foundation that enables rapid feature development and ensures code quality as the application grows.

**Primary Challenge:** The current codebase has evolved organically with components exceeding 1,000 lines, scattered API patterns, inconsistent type usage, and duplicated UI code. This creates maintainability issues and slows development velocity.

**Solution Approach:** Six targeted epics that systematically address architectural concerns while maintaining 100% functionality and user experience. Focus on developer experience improvements that enable the future intelligent features outlined in the project brief.

## Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source:** IDE-based fresh analysis of current React/Vite/TypeScript/Supabase application

**Current Project State:** 
Chicken Manager is a functional poultry management application with egg tracking, feed cost management, CRM capabilities, and flock management. Recent additions include Feed Cost Calculator and Chicken Viability Calculator, indicating active development and feature growth.

### Documentation Analysis

**Available Documentation:**
- ✅ Tech Stack Documentation (React/Vite/TypeScript/Supabase)
- ✅ Project Brief with roadmap (docs/brief.md)
- ✅ API Architecture (Supabase integration)
- ❌ Coding Standards (informal patterns observed)
- ❌ Component Architecture Documentation
- ❌ Technical Debt Documentation

### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type:**
- ✅ Performance/Scalability Improvements
- ✅ Technology Stack Upgrade (architectural improvements)
- ✅ Bug Fix and Stability Improvements (maintainability)

**Enhancement Description:**
Comprehensive structural refactoring to transform the current working prototype into a maintainable, scalable codebase that supports the intelligent features roadmap outlined in docs/brief.md.

**Impact Assessment:**
- ✅ Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes)

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**
- Reduce component complexity from 500-1000+ lines to focused, single-responsibility components
- Eliminate code duplication through centralized API layer and shared UI components
- Establish consistent type system that prevents runtime errors and improves developer experience
- Optimize state management to reduce unnecessary re-renders and improve performance
- Create maintainable foundation for implementing intelligent features (performance alerts, insights dashboard, community features)

**Background Context:**
The application has grown organically with successful user adoption and feature requests. To implement the intelligent features outlined in docs/brief.md (timeline-based intelligence, performance alerts, community safety net), we need a solid architectural foundation. Current technical debt would make these features difficult to implement and maintain.

## Requirements

**FR2:** Component interfaces must remain stable to prevent breaking changes in routing and user workflows

**FR3:** Database operations must maintain current performance characteristics and data integrity

**FR4:** User experience and visual appearance must remain unchanged during structural improvements

**FR5:** API endpoints and authentication flows must continue working without interruption

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** Component sizes must be reduced by 40%+ while maintaining functionality through focused single-responsibility design

**NFR2:** Code duplication must be eliminated through shared API layer and UI component library

**NFR3:** Type safety must be improved with elimination of 'any' types and consistent interface usage

**NFR4:** Performance must be maintained or improved through optimized state management and component rendering

**NFR5:** Developer experience must be significantly improved through better code organization and documentation

### Compatibility Requirements

**CR1: Database Schema Compatibility** - All database schemas and Supabase RLS policies must remain unchanged

**CR2: API Interface Compatibility** - Existing component props and exports must be preserved for routing compatibility  

**CR3: Authentication Compatibility** - Current Supabase Auth integration and user session management must be maintained
