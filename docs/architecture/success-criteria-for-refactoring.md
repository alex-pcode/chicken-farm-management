# Success Criteria for Refactoring

Based on the PRD requirements, the refactoring will be successful when:

1. **Component sizes reduced by 40%+** while maintaining functionality
2. **Zero 'any' types** in API layer and critical components - âœ… **API LAYER COMPLETE** (Story 1.2)
3. **Shared UI components** eliminate code duplication
4. **Domain-specific contexts** reduce unnecessary re-renders
5. **Centralized API service** provides consistent error handling
6. **All existing functionality preserved** during transformation
