# CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement

### Current State: Basic Vercel Integration ✅

Your Vercel deployment works, but missing **critical CI/CD practices**:

#### Missing: GitHub Actions Pipeline ❌

**Current**: Direct Vercel deployment from GitHub
**Gap**: No pre-deployment validation (tests, linting, type checking)

**Recommended Enhancement**:

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  quality-checks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: Type checking
        run: npm run type-check
      
      - name: Lint code
        run: npm run lint
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test
      
      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build
```

**Benefits During Refactoring**:
- Prevents broken code from reaching production
- Validates each Epic implementation
- Enables confident component refactoring

#### Missing: Deployment Environments ❌

**Current**: Single production environment
**Recommended**: Staging environment for refactoring validation
