# PWA Implementation for Offline Farm Management - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **farm manager**,  
I want **the chicken care app to work offline and be installable on my device**,  
So that **I can track my flock data even without internet connectivity and have quick access like a native app**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Vite build system, existing React app structure, Supabase data layer
- Technology: Vite PWA plugin, service worker, web app manifest
- Follows pattern: Existing Vite plugin architecture (similar to Sentry plugin)
- Touch points: `vite.config.mjs`, `index.html`, `public/` folder, main app entry

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. App displays install prompt on supported browsers when PWA criteria are met
2. App functions offline with cached pages and basic functionality available
3. App icon and metadata display correctly when installed as PWA

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing Vite build process continues to work unchanged with added PWA assets
5. New PWA functionality follows existing Vite plugin pattern (like Sentry)
6. Integration with Supabase maintains current behavior with graceful offline handling

**Quality Requirements:**
7. PWA implementation is covered by appropriate configuration and testing
8. Documentation is updated with PWA installation and offline capabilities
9. No regression in existing build process or app functionality verified

## Technical Notes

**Integration Approach:**
- Add `vite-plugin-pwa` to existing Vite plugin chain
- Create web app manifest with chicken care app branding
- Implement service worker for caching strategy compatible with Supabase architecture
- Add PWA meta tags to existing `index.html`

**Existing Pattern Reference:**
- Follow existing Vite plugin configuration pattern (see Sentry plugin in `vite.config.mjs:18-22`)
- Use existing public assets structure for PWA icons
- Maintain existing build optimization with PWA assets

**Key Constraints:**
- Must not interfere with existing Vercel deployment
- Must maintain compatibility with `npx vercel dev` for local development
- Service worker should cache static assets but respect Supabase real-time updates
- PWA manifest must align with existing "Chicken Manager" branding
- PWA features should work in both Vite dev mode and Vercel dev mode

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Vite PWA plugin installed and configured
- [ ] Web app manifest created with proper app metadata and icons  
- [ ] Service worker implemented with appropriate caching strategy
- [ ] PWA meta tags added to index.html
- [ ] App passes PWA audit (Lighthouse PWA score > 90)
- [ ] Install prompt appears on mobile devices
- [ ] Basic offline functionality verified (cached pages load)
- [ ] Existing build process works unchanged
- [ ] No breaking changes to current app functionality

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk**: Service worker caching conflicts with Supabase real-time updates
- **Mitigation**: Configure service worker to cache static assets only, exclude API calls
- **Rollback**: Remove PWA plugin from vite.config.mjs, delete manifest and SW files

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing Vite build configuration
- [ ] PWA assets are additive only (no changes to existing routes/components)
- [ ] Service worker respects existing Supabase authentication flow
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (PWA assets cached, not blocking)
- [ ] `npx vercel dev` continues to work with PWA features enabled
- [ ] Development workflow unchanged for both Vite and Vercel dev modes

   - Create web app manifest with proper metadata
   - Add Apple touch icons and meta tags

4. **Update HTML Template**
   - Add PWA meta tags to index.html
   - Include theme-color and viewport optimizations
   - Add manifest link reference

5. **Configure Service Worker**
   - Set up caching strategy for static assets
   - Configure runtime caching for API routes (if needed)
   - Ensure Supabase real-time updates work properly
