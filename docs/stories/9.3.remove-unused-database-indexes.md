## Story
**As a** database administrator,  
**I want** to remove unused indexes that are consuming storage and slowing write operations,  
**so that** I can optimize database performance and reduce storage overhead.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Audit all database indexes to identify genuinely unused indexes
2. Safely remove unused indexes that provide no query performance benefit
3. Verify removal doesn't impact any application functionality or query performance

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This addresses the storage and write performance optimization identified in database schema analysis. Multiple unused indexes are consuming storage and creating unnecessary overhead during INSERT/UPDATE operations without providing any query benefits. [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema-analysis.md#unused-indexes-wasting-resources-low-severity]

### Database Performance Issue
Current inefficiency from unused indexes [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema-analysis.md#unused-indexes-wasting-resources-low-severity]:
- **Problem**: 13 unused indexes consuming storage and slowing writes
- **Impact**: Unnecessary overhead on INSERT/UPDATE operations
- **Storage**: Wasted disk space on index maintenance
- **Write Performance**: Additional index updates on every data modification

### Unused Indexes Identified
Specific unused indexes found in database analysis [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema-analysis.md#unused-indexes-wasting-resources-low-severity]:

**Flock Management:**
- `idx_flock_batches_acquisition_date`
- `idx_flock_events_profile_date`

**Financial Tracking:**
- `idx_expenses_category`

**Feed Management:**
- `idx_feed_inventory_expiry`

**CRM System:**
- `idx_customers_name`
- `idx_sales_customer_id`
- `idx_sales_date`
- `idx_sales_paid`

**Death Records:**
- `idx_death_records_date`
- `idx_death_records_cause`

**Batch Events:**
- `idx_batch_events_user_id`
- `idx_batch_events_batch_id`
- `idx_batch_events_date`
- `idx_batch_events_type`

### SQL Commands for Index Removal
Commands to remove unused indexes [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema-analysis.md#priority-3-remove-unused-indexes-medium]:

```sql
-- Drop unused indexes (verify they're truly unused first)
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_flock_batches_acquisition_date;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_expenses_category;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_feed_inventory_expiry;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_flock_events_profile_date;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_customers_name;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_sales_customer_id;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_sales_date;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_sales_paid;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_death_records_date;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_death_records_cause;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_batch_events_user_id;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_batch_events_batch_id;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_batch_events_date;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_batch_events_type;
```

### Application Query Analysis
Verification against current API service patterns [Source: docs/architecture/api-service-implementation.md]:
- **FlockService**: Uses user_id indexes, not acquisition_date or profile_date indexes
- **DataService**: Main queries use user_id and date composite indexes, not individual category indexes
- **CRMService**: Customer queries use simple lookups, not name-based searches
- **ProductionService**: Feed queries use user-based filters, not expiry date searches

### Expected Performance Benefits
Performance improvements from index cleanup [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema-analysis.md#performance-impact-analysis]:
- **Write Performance**: Reduced index overhead during INSERTs/UPDATEs
- **Storage Efficiency**: Reclaimed disk space from unused index maintenance
- **Query Performance**: No impact (indexes weren't being used)
- **Maintenance**: Simplified index management and monitoring

### Safety Considerations
Risk mitigation for index removal:
- **Reversible Operations**: All DROP INDEX commands can be recreated if needed
- **Documentation**: Maintain list of removed indexes for potential restoration
- **Gradual Removal**: Remove indexes incrementally with testing between each
- **Usage Monitoring**: Double-check pg_stat_user_indexes before removal

### Application Integration Testing
Verification points for application functionality:
- **Dashboard Loading**: Ensure user data queries remain fast
- **Expense Filtering**: Verify category-based expense filtering works
- **Feed Management**: Check expiry date functionality in feed tracker
- **CRM Operations**: Test customer search and sales reporting
- **Timeline Views**: Validate flock event timeline displays

### Testing Standards

#### Testing Strategy
**Index Usage Verification:**
- Query pg_stat_user_indexes for zero-usage confirmation
- Analyze application query patterns against proposed removals
- EXPLAIN ANALYZE on critical queries to verify no performance regression
- Monitor index usage over time to catch sporadic usage patterns

**Application Functionality Testing:**
- Complete regression testing of all features
- Specific testing of features potentially using removed indexes
- Performance benchmarking of write operations
- Storage usage monitoring and measurement

**Testing Frameworks:** 
- PostgreSQL index usage statistics (pg_stat_user_indexes)
- Application performance monitoring
- Database storage analysis tools
- Comprehensive functional testing across all modules

**Safety Testing:**
- Incremental index removal with validation at each step
- Rollback testing to verify index recreation capability
- Load testing to measure write performance improvements
- Storage monitoring to confirm space reclamation
