## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 1.2 (Implement Type-Safe API Methods) is in "Ready for Review" status but provides the foundation for this migration work. That story successfully:
- Created comprehensive API response types with generic `ApiResponse<T>` interface
- Implemented custom error classes (AuthenticationError, NetworkError, ServerError) in `src/types/api.ts`
- Added complete JSDoc documentation and type safety to all API methods in `src/utils/authApiUtils.ts`
- Fixed type-casting issues in FlockBatchManager.tsx (removed 3 'as any' casts)
- Created comprehensive test suite with 17 tests covering type safety and error handling

### Current Component API Duplication Analysis
[Source: architecture/current-architecture-patterns-that-need-refactoring.md#api-layer-issues]

**Files with API duplications identified:**
- `src/components/EggCounter.tsx:18` - `saveToDatabase` function for egg entry persistence
- `src/components/Expenses.tsx` - Similar pattern for expense data saving  
- `src/components/FeedTracker.tsx` - Another variation for feed inventory tracking
- `src/utils/authApiUtils.ts` - Centralized but incomplete (now enhanced from Story 1.2)

**Current duplicate patterns:**
```typescript
// Duplicate saveToDatabase functions in multiple components
const saveToDatabase = async (data) => {
  // Similar but slightly different implementations
}
```

### API Service Layer Architecture Available
[Source: architecture/api-service-layer.md]

**Unified API service structure implemented in Story 1.1:**
```typescript
src/services/api/
├── BaseApiService.ts      # Abstract base class with common HTTP methods
├── AuthService.ts         # Authentication and session management
├── DataService.ts         # General data operations
├── ProductionService.ts   # Production-related operations (for this story)
├── FlockService.ts        # Flock management operations
├── types.ts              # API service type definitions
├── index.ts              # Unified exports and service instances
└── __tests__/            # Comprehensive unit test coverage
```

**Key service methods for component migration:**
- `apiService.production.saveEggEntries(entries: EggEntry[])` - For EggCounter.tsx
- `apiService.production.saveExpenses(expenses: Expense[])` - For Expenses.tsx
- `apiService.production.saveFeedInventory(inventory: FeedEntry[])` - For FeedTracker.tsx

### Component Integration Patterns to Follow
[Source: architecture/api-service-layer.md#component-integration]

**Migration pattern:**
```typescript
// Before
import { saveEggEntries } from '../utils/authApiUtils';

// After  
import { apiService } from '../services/api';
await apiService.production.saveEggEntries(entries);
```

**Error handling migration:**
```typescript
// Before (component-specific error handling)
try {
  await saveToDatabase(data);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Save failed:', error);
  setError('Something went wrong');
}

// After (standardized error handling)
try {
  await apiService.production.saveEggEntries(entries);
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ApiError) {
    if (error.status === 401) {
      // User automatically signed out by service layer
      console.log('Authentication failed');
    } else {
      console.error(`API Error ${error.status}: ${error.message}`);
      setError(error.message); // User-friendly error message
    }
  }
}
```

### File Structure and Import Updates
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Target component file locations:**
- `src/components/EggCounter.tsx` - 562 lines, production tracking
- `src/components/Expenses.tsx` - 462 lines, financial tracking  
- `src/components/FeedTracker.tsx` - 612 lines, inventory management

**Import updates required:**
- Replace individual `authApiUtils` function imports with unified `apiService` import
- Update error handling imports to use `ApiError` from `src/types/api.ts`
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing component patterns

### Type Safety Integration from Story 1.2
[Source: Story 1.2 completion notes]

**Available typed interfaces for components:**
- `EggEntry[]` type for egg production data
- `Expense[]` type for financial records
- `FeedEntry[]` type for inventory tracking
- `ApiResponse<T>` generic interface for consistent API responses
- Custom error classes: `AuthenticationError`, `NetworkError`, `ServerError`

### Legacy Compatibility Support
[Source: architecture/api-service-layer.md#legacy-compatibility]

**Compatibility layer available during migration:**
```typescript
import { legacyApi } from '../services/api';

// These still work during migration
await legacyApi.saveEggEntries(entries);
await legacyApi.saveExpenses(expenses);
```

### Performance and Caching Considerations
[Source: architecture/api-service-layer.md#performance-considerations]

**Service benefits for components:**
- Singleton pattern ensures consistent authentication state
- Automatic token refresh reduces redundant auth calls
- Consistent error handling reduces debugging overhead
- Type safety prevents runtime errors

**Integration with DataContext:**
The `DataContext` has already been updated to use the new API service (from Story 1.1), maintaining the existing 5-minute caching system while leveraging the consolidated API layer.

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-reality-2025-framework-recommendations.md]

**Test Framework Requirements:**
- **Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library (4x faster than Jest)
- **Test Location**: Component tests in same directory as components or `src/components/__tests__/`
- **Integration Testing**: Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API service mocking
- **Type Testing**: TypeScript compiler integration for compile-time validation

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- **Component behavior preservation**: Verify migrated components maintain identical behavior
- **API service integration**: Test that components correctly use domain-specific services
- **Error handling validation**: Test ApiError handling in component error scenarios  
- **Loading state preservation**: Verify loading states and user feedback remain identical
- **Backward compatibility**: Ensure component interfaces haven't changed
- **Integration testing**: Test end-to-end data flow from component to API service

**Test Categories Required:**
- Unit tests for component API service integration
- Integration tests for component + API service using MSW mocking
- Error handling tests with proper ApiError validation
- User interaction tests to verify identical behavior
- Component interface tests to ensure no breaking changes

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-09

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation successfully addresses all acceptance criteria with proper API service integration. The migration from duplicate `saveToDatabase` functions to the consolidated API service is well-executed. However, there was a critical bug in Profile.tsx that was fixed during review - an undefined `getAuthHeaders` function call that would have caused runtime errors.

All components now properly use the consolidated API service layer with standardized error handling and user-friendly messages. The developer maintained identical component behavior and interfaces while eliminating code duplication.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: src/components/Profile.tsx
  - **Change**: Fixed critical bug where `getAuthHeaders` was called but not imported, replaced with proper `apiService.flock.getFlockSummary()` call
  - **Why**: The missing import would have caused runtime errors when fetching flock summary data
  - **How**: Replaced the manual fetch + getAuthHeaders pattern with the consolidated API service method, improving consistency and reliability

- **File**: src/components/Profile.tsx  
  - **Change**: Updated response handling to match API service patterns
  - **Why**: The original code expected raw fetch response patterns instead of API service response structure
  - **How**: Changed from `response.ok` and `response.json()` to using `response.data` from API service

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Good adherence to TypeScript practices, minor linting warnings only
- Project Structure: ✓ Files properly organized, API service integration follows architecture
