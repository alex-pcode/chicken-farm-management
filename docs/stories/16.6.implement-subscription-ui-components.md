Based on the sharded architecture document:
- **Frontend Architecture**: `docs/lemonsqueezy-subscription-architecture/frontend-architecture.md`
- **Components**: `docs/lemonsqueezy-subscription-architecture/components.md` (SubscriptionUI)
- **UI Integration**: Current design system from existing components

### Component Implementation

#### File Structure
```
src/components/
├── subscription/
│   ├── SubscriptionStatus.tsx      # Subscription status display
│   ├── FeatureComparison.tsx       # Free vs Premium comparison
│   └── SubscriptionErrorBoundary.tsx  # Error handling
├── settings/
│   └── SubscriptionSettings.tsx    # Settings page integration
└── pages/
    ├── UpgradeSuccess.tsx          # Post-payment success
    ├── UpgradeCancelled.tsx        # Payment abandonment
    └── UpgradeError.tsx            # Payment error handling
```

#### SubscriptionStatus Component
```typescript
interface SubscriptionStatusProps {
  compact?: boolean;              // Compact view for dashboard widgets
  showActions?: boolean;          // Show manage/upgrade action buttons
  className?: string;             // Additional styling
}

export const SubscriptionStatus: React.FC<SubscriptionStatusProps> = ({
  compact = false,
  showActions = true,
  className
}) => {
  const { subscription, isPremium, isLoading } = useSubscription();
  
  // Implementation handles all subscription status display logic
};
```

#### FeatureComparison Component
```typescript
interface Feature {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  free: boolean | string;         // true/false or descriptive text
  premium: boolean | string;      // true/false or descriptive text
  highlight?: boolean;            // Highlight this feature as premium benefit
}

interface FeatureComparisonProps {
  features: Feature[];
  currentPlan: 'free' | 'premium';
  onUpgrade: () => void;
  showUpgradeButton?: boolean;
}
```

### UI/UX Specifications

#### Design System Integration
- **Colors**: Use existing primary/secondary color palette
- **Typography**: Consistent with existing heading and body text styles
- **Spacing**: Follow current Tailwind spacing scale
- **Components**: Leverage existing button, card, and table components
- **Icons**: Use existing icon library (likely Heroicons or similar)

#### Subscription Status Display
```typescript
// Status badge colors based on subscription state
const statusColors = {
  free: 'bg-gray-100 text-gray-800',
  active: 'bg-green-100 text-green-800', 
  cancelled: 'bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800',
  past_due: 'bg-red-100 text-red-800',
  paused: 'bg-blue-100 text-blue-800'
};
```

#### Feature Comparison Layout
- **Mobile**: Stacked cards with feature toggles
- **Desktop**: Side-by-side table with checkmarks/X marks
- **Premium Features**: Highlighted with accent color and icons
- **Current Access**: User's current level clearly indicated

### Navigation Integration

#### Settings Page Enhancement
```typescript
// Add to existing settings navigation
const settingsNavigation = [
  { name: 'Profile', href: '/settings/profile' },
  { name: 'Account', href: '/settings/account' },
  { name: 'Subscription', href: '/settings/subscription' }, // New
  { name: 'Security', href: '/settings/security' },
];
```

#### Route Configuration
```
/settings/subscription         # Main subscription settings page
/upgrade-success              # Post-payment success page
/upgrade-cancelled            # Payment abandonment page
/upgrade-error                # Payment error page
```

### Feature Comparison Content

#### Premium Features to Highlight
Based on architecture document:
- **CRM Features**: Customer database, sales tracking, customer insights
- **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed reports, profit analysis, trend tracking
- **Expense Management**: Comprehensive expense tracking, categorization, reporting
- **Feed Management**: Feed inventory, consumption tracking, cost analysis
- **Data Export**: CSV/PDF exports, backup capabilities
- **Savings Calculator**: Financial planning, ROI analysis, goal tracking
- **Priority Support**: Faster response times, dedicated support channel

#### Free Features to Show
- **Basic Egg Tracking**: Daily egg production logging
- **Basic Profile**: Simple flock information
- **Basic Dashboard**: Essential metrics and summaries

### Success/Error Page Specifications

#### Upgrade Success Page
- **Header**: "Welcome to Premium!" with celebration styling
- **Features Unlocked**: List of newly available premium features
- **Next Steps**: Clear guidance on exploring premium features
- **Navigation**: "Explore Premium Features" and "Back to Dashboard" buttons

#### Upgrade Cancelled Page  
- **Header**: "Upgrade Cancelled" with neutral styling
- **Message**: Understanding message about cancellation
- **Options**: "Try Again" button and link back to feature comparison

#### Upgrade Error Page
- **Header**: "Payment Error" with error styling
- **Error Message**: User-friendly explanation of what went wrong
- **Actions**: "Try Again" button and alternative payment options
- **Support**: Direct contact for payment issues

### Performance Considerations

#### Code Splitting
- **Subscription Components**: Split from core app bundle
- **Settings Page**: Lazy load subscription settings
- **Success/Error Pages**: Separate chunks for post-payment flows

#### Data Loading
- **Subscription Status**: Cache with DataContext integration
- **Feature Comparison**: Static content with user status overlay
- **Billing Information**: On-demand loading for settings page

### Testing Requirements

#### Unit Tests
- SubscriptionStatus component with various subscription states
- FeatureComparison component with free and premium users
- Success/error page rendering and navigation
- Settings page integration and navigation

#### Integration Tests
- Complete upgrade flow from feature gate to success page
- Settings navigation with subscription tab
- Responsive design testing on various screen sizes
- Error handling for subscription service failures

#### E2E Tests
- User subscription upgrade journey
- Subscription management workflows
- Post-payment redirection flows
- Cancel subscription flow
