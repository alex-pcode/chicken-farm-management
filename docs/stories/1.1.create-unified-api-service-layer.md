## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the comprehensive structural refactoring project. No previous story insights available.

### Data Models
Based on the existing codebase, the API layer handles these key data models [Source: src/utils/authApiUtils.ts]:
- **EggEntry**: Daily egg production tracking with date and count fields
- **Expense**: Financial tracking with date, category, description, amount
- **FeedEntry**: Feed inventory with brand, type, quantity, unit, dates, pricing
- **FlockProfile**: Farm details with bird counts (hens, roosters, chicks) and breed information
- **FlockEvent**: Timeline events with types (acquisition, laying_start, broody, hatching, other)

### API Specifications
Current API endpoints that need consolidation [Source: src/utils/authApiUtils.ts]:
- **GET /api/getData**: Fetches all user data, returns FetchDataResponse
- **POST /api/saveEggEntries**: Saves egg production entries, expects EggEntry[]
- **POST /api/saveExpenses**: Saves expense records, expects Expense[]
- **POST /api/saveFeedInventory**: Saves feed inventory, expects FeedEntry[]
- **POST /api/saveFlockProfile**: Saves flock profile data, expects FlockProfile
- **POST /api/saveFlockEvents**: Saves multiple flock events, expects FlockEvent[]
- **DELETE /api/deleteFlockEvent**: Deletes specific event, expects eventId
- **POST /api/migrateUserData**: Data migration endpoint

Authentication: All endpoints require Bearer token via getAuthHeaders() function with automatic refresh.

### Component Specifications
Components with duplicate API patterns that need updating [Source: docs/architecture.md#component-size-issues]:
- **EggCounter.tsx** (562 lines): Contains saveToDatabase function for egg entries
- **Expenses.tsx** (462 lines): Has similar saveToDatabase pattern for expenses
- **FeedTracker.tsx** (612 lines): Implements feed inventory saving pattern
- **Profile.tsx** (1039 lines): Complex component with multiple API calls

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: docs/architecture.md#source-tree-and-module-organization]:
- **Base Service**: Create `src/services/api/BaseApiService.ts`
- **Domain Services**: Create `src/services/api/DataService.ts`, `ProductionService.ts`, `FlockService.ts`, `CRMService.ts`
- **Service Index**: Create `src/services/api/index.ts` for barrel exports
- **Types**: Use existing consolidated types from `src/types/index.ts` and `src/types/api.ts`

### Technical Constraints
- **Type Safety**: Replace 'any' types with proper TypeScript interfaces [Source: docs/architecture.md#type-system-consolidation]
- **Authentication**: Maintain existing Supabase auth integration patterns
- **Error Handling**: Use established error classes: AuthenticationError, NetworkError, ServerError
- **Compatibility**: Preserve existing component interfaces during transition

### Testing Standards
Based on recommended testing strategy [Source: docs/architecture.md#testing-reality-2025-framework-recommendations]:
- **Unit Tests**: Test each service class with Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Integration Tests**: Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API endpoint testing
- **Test Location**: Create tests in `src/services/api/__tests__/` directory
- **Coverage**: Test authentication handling, error scenarios, and domain-specific operations

#### Testing
**Test File Location**: `src/services/api/__tests__/`

**Test Standards**:
- Use Vitest + MSW for API service testing
- Test authentication token handling and refresh scenarios
- Mock Supabase client responses for consistent testing
- Validate error handling for network, authentication, and server errors
- Test each domain service independently

**Testing Frameworks**: 
- Vitest for unit tests with jsdom environment
- MSW for mocking API responses without hitting Supabase
- React Testing Library for component integration tests

**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Test getAuthHeaders token refresh logic
- Validate consistent error handling across all services
- Test domain separation between services
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing component interfaces
