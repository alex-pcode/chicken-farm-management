# Story 1.2: Create Profile Experiment Tab

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to create an experimental duplicate of the Profile tab as a new "Experiment" tab,  
**so that** I can compare and test the current Profile component implementation against a refactored version during the Profile.tsx breakdown process.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create a new "Experiment" tab in the main navigation that duplicates the existing Profile tab functionality
2. The Experiment tab should be an exact functional copy of the current Profile.tsx component
3. Both tabs should work independently with their own state management
4. Navigation should clearly distinguish between "Profile" and "Experiment" tabs
5. The Experiment tab should maintain all existing functionality: flock profile management, event timeline, batch management, and statistics

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create experimental component structure (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Create `src/components/ExperimentProfile.tsx` as copy of Profile.tsx
  - [x] Ensure component independence and separate state management
  - [x] Verify all imports and dependencies are properly resolved
- [x] Update navigation to include Experiment tab (AC: 1, 4)
  - [x] Add "Experiment" route to main navigation in App.tsx
  - [x] Update desktop sidebar navigation to include Experiment tab
  - [x] Update mobile bottom dock navigation to include Experiment tab
  - [x] Ensure proper tab highlighting and active states
- [x] Test independent functionality (AC: 3, 5)
  - [x] Verify both Profile and Experiment tabs work simultaneously
  - [x] Test flock profile form functionality in Experiment tab
  - [x] Test event timeline management in Experiment tab
  - [x] Test batch management features in Experiment tab
  - [x] Test statistics display in Experiment tab
  - [x] Ensure data operations don't interfere between tabs

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1: The unified API service layer is now complete with domain separation (DataService, ProductionService, FlockService, CRMService). The ExperimentProfile component should use the same apiService patterns as the current Profile.tsx. [Source: docs/stories/1.1.create-unified-api-service-layer.md#completion-notes]

### Data Models
The Profile component handles these key data models that must be preserved in the Experiment tab [Source: src/components/Profile.tsx]:
- **FlockProfile**: Farm details with bird counts (hens, roosters, chicks, brooding), breed types, start date, notes
- **FlockEvent**: Timeline events with types (acquisition, laying_start, broody, hatching, other), date, description, affected birds
- **FlockSummary**: Batch management summary data from flock calculations

### API Specifications
Current Profile component uses these API patterns that should be maintained [Source: docs/stories/1.1.create-unified-api-service-layer.md#api-specifications]:
- **apiService.flock.getFlockSummary()**: Fetches batch management summary data
- **apiService.flock.saveFlockProfile()**: Saves flock profile changes
- **apiService.flock.saveFlockEvents()**: Saves multiple flock events
- **apiService.flock.deleteFlockEvent()**: Deletes specific event by ID
- **OptimizedDataProvider**: Uses cached data from context with 5-minute cache and background refresh

### Component Specifications
Current Profile.tsx structure that needs duplication [Source: docs/architecture/remaining-refactoring-tasks.md#current-state]:
- **File**: `src/components/Profile.tsx` (1,039 lines)
- **Key Features**: Flock profile form, event timeline management, batch manager integration, statistics display
- **State Management**: Uses OptimizedDataProvider context for cached data operations
- **Form Management**: Uses useFormState hook for event form handling
- **UI Components**: Integrates with shared form components (TextInput, NumberInput, DateInput, SelectInput, FormCard)

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#component-structure-standards]:
- **New Component**: Create `src/components/ExperimentProfile.tsx`
- **Navigation Updates**: Modify `src/App.tsx` for routing
- **Shared Components**: Use existing components from `src/components/forms/` and `src/components/ui/`
- **Types**: Import from existing `src/types/index.ts` (FlockProfile, FlockEvent, FlockSummary)

### Technical Constraints
- **Component Independence**: Ensure ExperimentProfile maintains separate state from Profile to prevent interference [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#component-structure-standards]
- **API Integration**: Use established apiService patterns for consistency [Source: docs/stories/1.1.create-unified-api-service-layer.md#dev-notes]
- **Context Usage**: Properly integrate with OptimizedDataProvider for data caching
- **Navigation Consistency**: Follow existing navigation patterns in App.tsx routing structure

### Testing Standards
Based on testing strategy [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]:
- **Component Tests**: Test ExperimentProfile component independently with React Testing Library
- **Navigation Tests**: Verify tab switching and route handling
- **Integration Tests**: Test interaction with OptimizedDataProvider context
- **Functionality Tests**: Verify all Profile features work identically in Experiment tab

#### Testing
**Test File Location**: `src/components/__tests__/ExperimentProfile.test.tsx`

**Test Standards**:
- Use Vitest + React Testing Library for component testing
- Test component rendering with OptimizedDataProvider context mocking
- Verify form interactions and state management
- Test API service integration using MSW mocks
- Ensure independent operation from Profile component

**Testing Frameworks**: 
- Vitest for unit tests with jsdom environment
- React Testing Library for component interaction testing
- MSW for API mocking without hitting Supabase

**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Test ExperimentProfile renders all sections (profile form, events, statistics)
- Verify navigation works correctly between Profile and Experiment tabs
- Test form submission and data persistence through apiService
- Ensure component independence (changes in one tab don't affect the other)
- Test error handling and loading states

### Refactoring Methodology and Benefits

#### **Code Reduction Metrics**
- **Original Profile.tsx**: 887 lines (monolithic component)
- **Refactored ExperimentProfile.tsx**: 156 lines (**82% reduction**)
- **Extracted Components**: 761 lines across 3 reusable components

#### **Component Extraction Strategy**
1. **FlockSummaryDisplay** (316 lines): Handles batch management statistics, loading states, and migration notices
2. **EventForm** (216 lines): Manages event creation, editing, and form validation with API integration
3. **EventTimeline** (229 lines): Displays event timeline with desktop/mobile layouts and interactive controls

#### **Architecture Benefits Achieved**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one focused purpose
- **Reusability**: Components can be used across multiple features
- **Testability**: Smaller components are easier to test in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Changes to specific functionality affect only relevant components
- **Performance**: Better code-splitting and tree-shaking opportunities

#### **Demonstrated Refactoring Pattern**
This refactoring demonstrates the exact approach for breaking down large components:
1. Identify logical UI sections with distinct responsibilities
2. Extract each section into a focused, reusable component
3. Define clear prop interfaces for component communication
4. Maintain state coordination in the parent component
5. Preserve existing functionality while improving structure

#### **Future Applications**
- Original Profile.tsx can now be refactored using these same components
- Flock-related features can leverage the extracted components
- Pattern can be applied to other large components in the codebase
