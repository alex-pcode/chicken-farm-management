# App Tiers Implementation - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **poultry farm manager**,
I want **the app to display different features based on my subscription tier**,
So that **I can see which features are available to me and understand the value of upgrading to premium**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: OptimizedDataProvider caching system and React Router navigation
- Technology: React 19 + TypeScript with lazy-loaded components
- Follows pattern: Component wrapping and conditional rendering patterns
- Touch points: App.tsx navigation arrays, OptimizedDataProvider context, component routing

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Free tier users can access**: Production (EggCounter) with full functionality and Account Settings only
2. **Premium tier features**: Dashboard, My Flock (Profile), CRM, Expenses, Feed Management, Savings, and Viability require premium subscription
3. **Navigation adapts to tier**: Free users see only Production and Account in navigation menus

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing **OptimizedDataProvider caching** continues to work unchanged
5. New functionality follows existing **lazy component loading** pattern  
6. Integration with **React Router** maintains current navigation behavior

**Quality Requirements:**
7. **Testing capability**: Admin interface or database toggle to switch user tier for testing
8. Change is covered by appropriate tests
9. Documentation is updated if needed
10. No regression in existing functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Add tier state to OptimizedDataProvider, wrap premium components with feature gates
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow App.tsx component lazy loading and conditional navigation patterns
- **Key Constraints**: Must work without payment integration, prepare foundation for future subscription system

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Free tier navigation shows only: Production, Account
- [ ] Database migration adds subscription_status field to users table
- [ ] Testing mechanism implemented (admin toggle or database direct update)
- [ ] Tier state integrates with OptimizedDataProvider caching system
- [ ] Component lazy loading pattern maintained for all feature gates
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing React 19 + TypeScript patterns
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Mobile navigation shows only Production and Account for free tier users

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk**: Breaking existing navigation or data flow patterns
- **Mitigation**: Use component wrapping approach, extend rather than replace existing systems
- **Rollback**: Remove feature gate components, revert navigation arrays to current state

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes are minimal (add subscription_status field to users table)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing neu-button and navigation design patterns  
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible (adds simple boolean checks only)

## Integration Architecture

**Key Integration Points:**

1. **OptimizedDataProvider Extension**: Add `userTier: 'free' | 'premium'` to cached data state
2. **Navigation Filtering**: Split navigation arrays based on tier (free vs premium features)  
3. **Component Wrapping**: Create `<PremiumFeatureGate>` component for upgrade prompts
4. **Route Protection**: Wrap premium routes with tier checks and upgrade redirects

**Implementation Foundation**: This story prepares the app architecture for future payment integration while providing immediate tier-based feature separation.
