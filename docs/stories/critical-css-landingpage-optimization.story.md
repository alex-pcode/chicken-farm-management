# Story: Critical CSS Optimization for Landing Page

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** website visitor,  
**I want** the landing page to load faster with critical CSS optimization,  
**so that** I experience immediate visual content without layout shifts or delayed styling.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Critical above-the-fold CSS is inlined in HTML head for immediate rendering
2. Non-critical CSS is loaded asynchronously to prevent render blocking
3. Landing page First Contentful Paint (FCP) improves by 20-30%
4. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) remains under 2.5 seconds
5. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is minimized through proper CSS loading
6. Hero section, navigation, and primary CTA render immediately
7. Background animations and non-essential styles load progressively
8. CSS file size is optimized with unused styles removed
9. Build process automatically generates critical CSS extraction

### Debug Log References
- Successfully identified 82-line inline style block in LandingPage component
- Critical CSS extraction processing completed with Critters plugin
- Animations now load asynchronously after initial render using requestIdleCallback

### Completion Notes
**Major Performance Improvements Achieved:**

1. **CSS Code Splitting:**
   - Extracted inline styles (82 lines) to separate CSS modules
   - Critical styles: `landing-hero.css` (essential above-the-fold content)
   - Non-critical animations: `landing-animations.css` (loaded asynchronously)
   - Component styles: `landing-components.css` (feature sections)

2. **Critical CSS Pipeline:**
   - Implemented Critters-based critical CSS extraction in build process
   - Above-the-fold styles automatically inlined in HTML head
