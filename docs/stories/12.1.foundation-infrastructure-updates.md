# Story 12.1: Foundation & Infrastructure Updates

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer working on the styling system,  
**I want** to enhance the CSS infrastructure with glass card variants, OKLCH color variables, and responsive utilities,  
**so that** all components have access to consistent design tokens and utility classes for implementing the new styling patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Add OKLCH color variables to index.css for consistent usage across components
2. Create glass card mixin variations (default, compact, detailed, loading states) 
3. Update typography scale based on CardShowcase patterns
4. Add responsive grid utility classes matching CardShowcase layouts
5. Create animation/transition utility classes for consistent interactions
6. Define .glass-card-variants for different use cases
7. Implement tab navigation component classes
8. Add loading state styling utilities
9. Create consistent form styling classes

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Update any conflicting legacy styles

## Dev Notes

### Current CSS Infrastructure Analysis
The existing `src/index.css` file contains a strong foundation with:
- **OKLCH Color System**: Already implemented with primary color `oklch(0.205 0 0)` and comprehensive color palette
- **Neumorphic Variables**: Existing neumorphic design tokens (--neu-1: #ecf0f3, --neu-2: #d1d9e6)
- **Typography Foundation**: Fraunces font family with optical sizing and variation settings
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Comprehensive variable system for colors, spacing, shadows, and effects
- **Tailwind Integration**: Using Tailwind CSS 4.x with custom variant support

### Glass Card Pattern Requirements
Based on CardShowcase.tsx analysis and Epic 12 requirements:
- **Backdrop Filter**: `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` for glass effect
- **Shadow System**: Consistent shadow variations for depth hierarchy
- **Border Integration**: Subtle borders to enhance glass card definition
- **Responsive Behavior**: Cards must adapt to mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts
- **Interactive States**: Hover and focus states for user feedback

[Source: docs/styling-implementation-plan.md patterns analysis]

### Design System Integration Points
Key integration requirements with existing shared components:
- **FormCard Components**: Located in `src/components/ui/forms/` - require glass styling integration
- **StatCard/MetricDisplay**: Located in `src/components/ui/cards/` - primary targets for glass card application
- **Modal Components**: Located in `src/components/ui/modals/` - require glass backdrop styling
- **Navigation Components**: Tab system patterns need glass card integration

### Technology Stack Considerations
From architecture documentation:
- **Tailwind CSS 4.1.4**: Latest version with 5x faster builds and zero configuration
- **PostCSS Integration**: CSS processing with `@tailwindcss/postcss` and `@tailwindcss/vite`
- **Framer Motion 12.7.4**: Animation library for transition and interaction effects
- **Performance Focus**: Must maintain sub-second hot reload and optimized production builds

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#styling--design-system]

### File Structure and Naming Conventions
Following established coding standards:
- **CSS Organization**: Utility classes grouped by function (layout, colors, effects, animations)
- **Class Naming**: Follow Tailwind conventions with design system prefixes (.glass-card, .form-glass)
- **Import Organization**: Maintain proper import order in index.css
- **Documentation**: JSDoc-style comments for CSS utility classes

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#css-and-styling-standards]

### Responsive Design Requirements
Mobile-first approach with breakpoints:
- **Mobile**: 375px+ (primary touch interface optimization)
- **Tablet**: 768px+ (adaptive layout transitions)
- **Desktop**: 1920px+ (full feature layout)
- **Performance**: 60fps animations across all device sizes

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#browser-support]

### Accessibility and Performance Standards
Critical requirements for new styling:
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliance for all color combinations
- **Motion Preferences**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px touch targets for mobile interfaces
- **Screen Reader**: Proper ARIA integration with visual state changes

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]

### Integration with Existing Components
Priority integration targets based on usage frequency:
1. **StatCard.tsx** - High usage in dashboards, immediate visual impact
2. **FormCard.tsx** - Core form interactions, consistent UX requirement
3. **Modal.tsx** - Overlay contexts, glass backdrop critical for visual hierarchy
4. **DataTable.tsx** - Data display consistency, professional appearance

## Testing

### Testing Standards Requirements
From architecture documentation:
- **Unit Testing**: Vitest framework with React Testing Library
- **Coverage Target**: 90%+ test coverage for CSS utility functionality
- **Visual Testing**: Screenshot comparison for styling consistency
- **Accessibility Testing**: Automated accessibility audits using testing tools

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]

### Test Implementation Strategy
- **CSS Utility Tests**: Verify utility classes apply correct styles
- **Responsive Tests**: Validate breakpoint behavior across device sizes
- **Integration Tests**: Test styling with existing shared components
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure no regression in animation performance
- **Cross-browser Tests**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge compatibility

### Test File Locations
Following established patterns:
- **Unit Tests**: `src/components/ui/__tests__/` for component integration tests
- **Utility Tests**: `src/utils/__tests__/` for CSS utility validation
- **Visual Tests**: Integration with existing visual consistency testing framework
