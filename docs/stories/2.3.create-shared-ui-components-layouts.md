### Component Design Patterns to Follow
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#component-structure-standard]

**Shared UI component structure standard:**
```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
import type { ComponentProps, VariantProps } from '../types';

interface SharedComponentProps extends ComponentProps {
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger';
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  className?: string;
}

export const SharedComponent: React.FC<SharedComponentProps> = ({ 
  variant = 'primary',
  size = 'md',
  className = '',
  children,
  ...props 
}) => {
  // 1. Variant and size calculations
  const variantClasses = getVariantClasses(variant);
  const sizeClasses = getSizeClasses(size);
  
  // 2. Combined className
  const combinedClassName = `${baseClasses} ${variantClasses} ${sizeClasses} ${className}`;
  
  // 3. Render with motion support
  return (
    <motion.div 
      className={combinedClassName}
      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
      {...props}
    >
      {children}
    </motion.div>
  );
};
```

### TypeScript Standards for UI Components
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#typescript-standards]

**Interface naming for UI components:**
```typescript
// Base component props
interface BaseUIComponentProps {
  className?: string;
  children?: React.ReactNode;
  testId?: string;
}

// Table component props
interface DataTableProps<T> extends BaseUIComponentProps {
  data: T[];
  columns: TableColumn<T>[];
  loading?: boolean;
  emptyMessage?: string;
  sortable?: boolean;
  onSort?: (column: keyof T, direction: 'asc' | 'desc') => void;
}

// Modal component props
interface ModalProps extends BaseUIComponentProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  title?: string;
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl';
  closeOnBackdrop?: boolean;
}

// Stat card component props
interface StatCardProps extends BaseUIComponentProps {
  title: string;
  value: string | number;
  change?: number;
  changeType?: 'increase' | 'decrease';
  trend?: 'up' | 'down' | 'neutral';
  loading?: boolean;
}
```

### Tailwind Design System Integration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tailwind-css-v4-priority-update]

**Tailwind v4 features to leverage:**
- 5x faster builds during component development
- Zero config setup for design system tokens
- Enhanced utility classes for component variants

**Design system class organization:**
```typescript
// Component variant classes
const variantClasses = {
  primary: 'bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-700',
  secondary: 'bg-gray-200 text-gray-900 hover:bg-gray-300',
  danger: 'bg-red-600 text-white hover:bg-red-700',
};

// Component size classes
const sizeClasses = {
  sm: 'px-3 py-2 text-sm',
  md: 'px-4 py-3 text-base',
  lg: 'px-6 py-4 text-lg',
};

// Consistent spacing system
const spacingClasses = {
  cardPadding: 'p-6',
  sectionGap: 'space-y-6',
  gridGap: 'gap-6',
};
```

### Animation Patterns with Framer Motion
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#framer-motion]

**Motion patterns for UI components:**
```typescript
// Modal animation variants
const modalVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, scale: 0.8 },
  visible: { opacity: 1, scale: 1 },
  exit: { opacity: 0, scale: 0.8 },
};

// Card hover animations
const cardVariants = {
  hover: { 
    scale: 1.02,
    boxShadow: '0 10px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)',
  },
};

// List item animations
const listItemVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
  visible: { opacity: 1, y: 0 },
};
```

### Integration with Form Components and Hooks
[Source: Stories 2.1 and 2.2 context]

**Integration points with previous stories:**
- Modal components will use form components from Story 2.1
- Table components will use pagination hooks from Story 2.2
- Stat cards will use data management hooks from Story 2.2
- List components will integrate with form validation from Story 2.1

### Accessibility Standards
**Accessibility requirements for UI components:**
- All interactive components must support keyboard navigation
- Modal components must trap focus and support ESC key
- Table components must have proper ARIA labels and sorting indicators
- Stat cards must have accessible descriptions for screen readers
- Color contrast must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### Legacy Compatibility
All shared UI components must maintain backward compatibility with existing component interfaces to ensure no breaking changes during migration.

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-reality-2025-framework-recommendations.md]

**Test Framework Requirements:**
- **Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library (4x faster than Jest)
- **Test Location**: Component tests in `src/components/ui/__tests__/` or alongside components
- **Integration Testing**: Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for components that fetch data
- **Type Testing**: TypeScript compiler integration for compile-time validation
- **Accessibility Testing**: Use @testing-library/jest-dom for accessibility assertions

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- **Component rendering**: Test UI components render correctly with various props
- **User interaction**: Test modal opening/closing, table sorting, pagination navigation
- **Accessibility testing**: Test keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, screen reader support
- **Visual consistency**: Test component variants and sizes render correctly
- **Integration testing**: Test components work with hooks from Story 2.2
- **Performance testing**: Verify components render efficiently with large data sets

**Test Categories Required:**
- Unit tests for individual UI components (tables, modals, cards, pagination)
- Integration tests for components with data management hooks
- User interaction tests for modal dialogs and interactive elements
- Accessibility tests for keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- Visual regression tests for component appearance and styling
- Performance tests for table rendering with large data sets

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-20

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: ✅ GOOD** - The implementation successfully delivers a solid foundation for shared UI components with proper TypeScript integration, accessibility considerations, and demonstrated migration path. However, several critical improvements were needed and have been addressed.

**Strengths:**
- Well-structured component hierarchy following architecture standards  
- Proper TypeScript interfaces with generic support (DataTable<T>)
- Integration with existing tech stack (Framer Motion, Tailwind CSS)
- Demonstrated successful migration of existing components
- Comprehensive prop interfaces with sensible defaults

**Issues Found & Resolved:**
- Framer Motion prop warnings in StatCard component
- Modal accessibility improvements needed
- Test reliability issues with loading states
- Missing focus management in modals

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `src/components/ui/cards/StatCard.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed Framer Motion whileHover prop usage from string variant to direct object
  - **Why**: Prevents React DOM warnings about unrecognized props
  - **How**: Changed `whileHover="hover"` to `whileHover={cardVariants.hover}` for direct animation values

- **File**: `src/components/ui/modals/Modal.tsx` 
  - **Change**: Enhanced accessibility with focus management, ARIA attributes, and proper semantic structure
  - **Why**: Ensures compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards and screen reader compatibility  
  - **How**: Added focus trap on modal open, aria-modal, role="dialog", aria-labelledby, and proper heading structure

- **File**: `src/components/ui/__tests__/StatCard.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Improved loading state test reliability
  - **Why**: Original test was looking for text that doesn't exist in loading skeleton
  - **How**: Changed test to look for `.animate-pulse` class instead of loading text

- **File**: `src/components/ui/__tests__/DataTable.test.tsx` 
  - **Change**: Fixed loading state test to check for actual rendered elements
  - **Why**: Test was failing because loading spinner has no text content
  - **How**: Changed to check for `.animate-spin` class presence instead of text

- **File**: `src/components/ui/tables/DataTable.tsx`
  - **Change**: Improved row key generation for better React reconciliation
  - **Why**: Using array index alone can cause rendering issues with dynamic data
  - **How**: Changed key from `index` to `row-${index}` for more explicit identification

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✅ **PASS** - Components follow established patterns, proper import organization, consistent TypeScript usage
- **Project Structure**: ✅ **PASS** - Files organized correctly in `src/components/ui/` with logical subdirectories  
- **Testing Strategy**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Core tests present but some edge cases and accessibility tests missing
- **All ACs Met**: ✅ **PASS** - All 4 Acceptance Criteria successfully implemented with working components

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed Framer Motion prop warnings in StatCard component
- [x] Enhanced Modal accessibility with focus management and ARIA attributes  
- [x] Improved test reliability for loading states in both components
- [x] Added proper semantic HTML structure to Modal component
- [x] Enhanced row key generation in DataTable for better performance
- [ ] Consider adding more comprehensive accessibility tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- [ ] Add integration tests for DataTable with actual sorting functionality  
- [ ] Consider adding visual regression tests for component variants
- [ ] Add performance tests for large datasets in DataTable
- [ ] Complete remaining component variants (AlertDialog, MetricDisplay, ProgressCard)

### Security Review

**✅ No security concerns identified**
- Components properly sanitize user inputs through controlled interfaces
- No direct DOM manipulation or innerHTML usage 
- TypeScript provides compile-time safety for props and data handling
- Modal component properly handles focus management without security vulnerabilities

### Performance Considerations

**✅ Performance optimized with minor improvements made**
- Framer Motion animations are properly configured with reasonable delays
- DataTable uses efficient rendering with proper React keys
- Loading states prevent unnecessary renders during data fetching
- StatCard variants use CSS classes rather than inline styles for better performance

**Recommendations:**
- Consider implementing virtualization for DataTable with very large datasets (>1000 rows)
- Add useMemo for expensive column calculations if needed in future
- Current implementation performs well for typical use cases

### Migration Success

**✅ Successfully demonstrated working integration**
- Profile.tsx and EggCounter.tsx successfully migrated to use shared StatCard
- No breaking changes introduced during migration
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Components maintain backward compatibility

### Final Status

**⚠️ CHANGES REQUIRED - Foundation Complete, Full Implementation Needed**

**REVISED ASSESSMENT:** Upon detailed analysis of subtask completion, this story represents a **solid foundation** but is **not complete** according to standard Definition of Done criteria.

**What's Complete (✅):**
- Core component foundation with proper architecture
- Basic implementations of DataTable, StatCard, Modal, Pagination
- Working TypeScript interfaces and accessibility features  
- Demonstrated migration path with 2 components successfully migrated
- Comprehensive test framework established

**What's Missing (❌):**
- **~15 component variants** (AlertDialog, MetricDisplay, ProgressCard, FormModal, etc.)
- **Major component migrations** (Expenses.tsx, FeedTracker.tsx, FlockBatchManager.tsx still using old patterns)
- **Complete pagination integration** with existing hooks from Story 2.2
- **Layout container system** (GridContainer, CardContainer)
- **Full test coverage** for all interaction patterns and accessibility

**Recommendation:**
1. **Option A**: Accept current foundation as "Phase 1" and create follow-up stories for remaining work
2. **Option B**: Continue development to complete all subtasks before marking Done
3. **Option C**: Split story into "Foundation" (current work) and "Migration & Variants" (remaining work)

**PRODUCT OWNER DECISION: Continue development to complete all defined subtasks**

**Updated Status:** Story returned to InProgress for completion of remaining work
- Development team should continue with the ~27 remaining subtasks
- Priority focus on major component migrations (Expenses.tsx, FeedTracker.tsx, FlockBatchManager.tsx)
- Complete all component variants as originally scoped
- Ensure full integration with Story 2.2 pagination hooks
- Achieve comprehensive test coverage including accessibility testing

**Target:** Complete all subtasks before returning to Ready for Review status
