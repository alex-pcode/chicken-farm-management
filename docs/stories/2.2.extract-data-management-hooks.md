## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 2.1 (Extract Form Validation & Input Components) will provide shared form components that these hooks will integrate with, particularly for form state management and validation hooks.

### Current State Management Analysis
[Source: architecture/current-architecture-patterns-that-need-refactoring.md#component-size-issues]

**Components with excessive state management:**
- `src/components/Profile.tsx` - 1039 lines with multiple responsibilities, form handling, data display, API calls
- `src/components/EggCounter.tsx` - 562 lines with production tracking, statistics, form handling
- `src/components/FeedTracker.tsx` - 612 lines with inventory management, form handling, data display
- `src/components/Expenses.tsx` - 462 lines with financial tracking forms and state logic

### DataContext Integration Opportunities
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#key-modules-and-their-purpose]

**Current DataContext pattern:**
- `src/contexts/DataContext.tsx` - Intelligent 5-minute caching, now uses unified API services
- Singleton pattern for consistent authentication state
- Automatic token refresh reduces redundant auth calls

**Hook integration strategy:**
Custom hooks will leverage existing DataContext while providing component-specific state management patterns.

### React 19 Hook Patterns to Leverage
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-alignment-with-refactoring-epics]

**React 19 features perfect for custom hooks:**
- React 19 Actions - ideal for form-centric API calls in hooks
- useFormStatus - eliminates form prop drilling in custom form hooks
- Enhanced useCallback and useMemo performance

### File Structure for Custom Hooks
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Target hook file locations:**
- `src/hooks/` - New directory for custom hooks
  - `pagination/` - Pagination-specific hooks
    - `usePagination.ts` - Generic pagination logic
    - `useEggPagination.ts` - Egg data pagination
    - `useExpensePagination.ts` - Financial data pagination
  - `data/` - Data management hooks
    - `useDataFetch.ts` - Generic data fetching
    - `useEggData.ts` - Egg production data management
    - `useExpenseData.ts` - Financial data management
    - `useFeedData.ts` - Feed inventory data management
  - `forms/` - Form state management hooks
    - `useFormState.ts` - Generic form state
    - `useFormValidation.ts` - Form validation logic
    - `useFormSubmit.ts` - Form submission handling
  - `utils/` - Utility hooks
    - `useLocalStorage.ts` - Local storage integration
    - `useDebounce.ts` - Input debouncing
    - `useAsync.ts` - Async operation handling

### Hook Design Patterns to Follow
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#component-structure-standard]

**Custom hook structure standard:**
```typescript
import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';
import type { HookOptions, HookReturn } from '../types';

export const useCustomHook = <T>(options: HookOptions<T>): HookReturn<T> => {
  // 1. State declarations
  const [state, setState] = useState<T>();
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState<Error | null>(null);
  
  // 2. Memoized callbacks
  const handleAction = useCallback(() => {
    // Hook logic
  }, [dependencies]);
  
  // 3. Effects
  useEffect(() => {
    // Effect logic
  }, [dependencies]);
  
  // 4. Return stable object
  return useMemo(() => ({
    data: state,
    loading,
    error,
    actions: {
      handleAction,
    },
  }), [state, loading, error, handleAction]);
};
```

### TypeScript Standards for Hooks
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#typescript-standards]

**Interface naming for hooks:**
```typescript
// Hook options interface
interface UsePaginationOptions {
  pageSize?: number;
  initialPage?: number;
  totalItems?: number;
}

// Hook return interface
interface UsePaginationReturn {
  currentPage: number;
  totalPages: number;
  pageSize: number;
  goToPage: (page: number) => void;
  nextPage: () => void;
  previousPage: () => void;
  isFirstPage: boolean;
  isLastPage: boolean;
}

// Generic data hook interfaces
interface UseDataFetchOptions<T> {
  key: string;
  fetcher: () => Promise<T>;
  cacheTime?: number;
  staleTime?: number;
}

interface UseDataFetchReturn<T> {
  data: T | undefined;
  error: Error | null;
  isLoading: boolean;
  isValidating: boolean;
  mutate: () => Promise<void>;
}
```

### Integration with Existing API Service Layer
[Source: Previous Story Context - API Service Layer from Story 1.1]

**Custom hooks will integrate with consolidated API services:**
```typescript
// Example data hook using API service
import { apiService } from '../services/api';

export const useEggData = () => {
  // Hook will use apiService.production.getEggEntries()
  // Instead of individual component API calls
};
```

### Performance Considerations
[Source: architecture/current-architecture-patterns-that-need-refactoring.md#state-management-issues]

**Current DataContext issues that hooks can address:**
- Single context causes unnecessary re-renders
- All components get all data even if they don't need it
- Cache invalidation is all-or-nothing

**Hook-based solutions:**
- Component-specific data hooks reduce unnecessary re-renders
- Selective data fetching based on component needs
- Granular cache management per data type

### Import Organization for Hooks
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#import-organization-standard]

**Import structure for custom hooks:**
```typescript
// 1. React and core libraries
import { useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';

// 2. Third-party libraries (if needed)

// 3. Internal hooks and contexts
import { useAuth } from '../contexts/AuthContext';
import { useDataContext } from '../contexts/DataContext';

// 4. Components (usually none for hooks)

// 5. Utils and helpers
import { apiService } from '../services/api';

// 6. Types (always last)
import type { EggEntry, PaginationOptions } from '../types';
```

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-reality-2025-framework-recommendations.md]

**Test Framework Requirements:**
- **Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library (4x faster than Jest)
- **Test Location**: Hook tests in `src/hooks/__tests__/` or alongside hook files
- **Hook Testing**: Use @testing-library/react-hooks for testing custom hooks
- **Integration Testing**: Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API-dependent hooks
- **Type Testing**: TypeScript compiler integration for compile-time validation

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- **Hook behavior testing**: Test state management, data fetching, and caching behavior
- **Hook integration testing**: Test hooks work correctly with components
- **Error handling testing**: Test hooks handle API errors and edge cases properly
- **Performance testing**: Verify hooks reduce component re-renders as expected
- **useState reduction verification**: Measure and verify 50%+ reduction in component useState calls
- **Backward compatibility**: Ensure components maintain identical behavior after hook migration

**Test Categories Required:**
- Unit tests for individual custom hooks (pagination, data fetching, form state)
- Integration tests for hooks with API services and DataContext
- Performance tests to verify re-render reduction
- Edge case tests for hook error handling and loading states
- Component integration tests to verify hook migration maintains behavior
