# Simple Feed Tracking Guide

## Overview
The simplified Feed Tracker helps you manage feed for chickens based on their age and size, not complex analytics. It uses three simple feed categories and estimates consumption based on your current flock composition.

## Feed Types

### üê£ Baby chicks
- **For:** Birds 0-6 weeks old
- **Consumption:** ~30g (0.03kg) per day per chick
- **Examples:** Starter feed, chick crumbles

### üêî Big chicks  
- **For:** Birds 6+ weeks old (layers, adults)
- **Consumption:** ~120g (0.12kg) per day per bird
- **Examples:** Layer feed, grower feed, adult pellets

### üåæ Both
- **For:** Mixed age flocks
- **Consumption:** Average rate based on flock composition
- **Examples:** All-flock feed, family feeder

## How to Use

### 1. Set Up Your Flock Profile
Make sure your **Profile** section has accurate bird counts:
- **Chicks:** Number of baby birds (0-6 weeks)
- **Hens + Roosters:** Number of adult birds (6+ weeks)

### 2. Add Feed Purchases
1. Click "Add New Feed"
2. Choose the appropriate feed type:
   - **Baby chicks** if only feeding young birds
   - **Big chicks** if only feeding adult birds  
   - **Both** if using all-flock feed
3. Fill in brand, quantity, price, and purchase date

### 3. View Feed Estimator
1. Click "Show Feed Estimator" 
2. See your daily, weekly, and monthly feed needs
3. Check how long your current feed will last
4. Get alerts when feed is running low

## Understanding the Estimator

### Current Flock Display
- Shows your baby chicks vs adult birds
- Displays consumption rates for each group
- Calculates total daily need for your entire flock

### Active Feed Status
- Lists all active (non-depleted) feed bags
- Shows estimated days remaining for each bag
- Color-coded alerts:
  - üî¥ **Red:** Less than 7 days remaining
  - üü† **Orange:** 7-14 days remaining  
  - üü¢ **Green:** More than 14 days remaining

### Planning Examples

#### Scenario 1: New Chicks Arriving
You have 8 adult hens and are getting 15 baby chicks:
1. Update your Profile: 8 hens, 15 chicks
2. Buy "Baby chicks" feed for the new arrivals
3. Keep "Big chicks" feed for your adults
4. Estimator shows you now need ~1.4kg per day total

#### Scenario 2: Chicks Growing Up
Your 20 baby chicks are now 7 weeks old:
1. Update Profile: 20 birds moved from chicks to hens
2. Switch from "Baby chicks" to "Big chicks" feed
3. Consumption jumps from 0.6kg/day to 2.4kg/day
4. Plan larger feed purchases accordingly

#### Scenario 3: Simplifying with All-Flock Feed
You have mixed ages and want one feed type:
1. Buy "Both" type feed suitable for all ages
2. Estimator averages consumption based on your flock mix
3. Simpler management, one feed type to track

## Tips for Success

### Keep Profiles Updated
- ‚úÖ Update bird counts when chicks grow up (6 weeks)
- ‚úÖ Update when buying/selling birds
- ‚úÖ Record hatching events in timeline

### Smart Feed Planning
- **Baby chicks grow fast** - their consumption quadruples at 6 weeks
- **Plan transitions** - buy adult feed before chicks outgrow starter
- **Monitor closely** - young flocks change consumption rapidly
- **Seasonal factors** - birds eat more in cold weather

### Timeline Integration
The system works best when you:
- Record hatching events in your flock timeline
- Update flock composition as birds mature
- Track major flock changes (acquisitions, sales)

## Consumption Reference

| Bird Type | Age | Daily Feed | Weekly Feed | Monthly Feed |
|-----------|-----|------------|-------------|--------------|
| Baby chick | 0-6 weeks | 30g | 210g | 900g |
| Adult bird | 6+ weeks | 120g | 840g | 3.6kg |

### Example Calculations
- **10 baby chicks:** 300g/day = 2.1kg/week = 9kg/month
- **10 adult birds:** 1.2kg/day = 8.4kg/week = 36kg/month  
- **Mixed flock (5 babies + 5 adults):** 750g/day = 5.25kg/week = 22.5kg/month

This simplified approach gives you practical feed planning without complex analytics, focusing on the key factor that drives consumption: bird age and size.
