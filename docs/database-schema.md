# Database Schema Documentation

## Overview

The Chicken Manager application uses Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Row Level Security (RLS) enabled for multi-user data isolation. Each table includes a `user_id` column to associate records with specific users.

## Authentication & Security

### User Authentication (Supabase Auth)
Supabase provides built-in user authentication with the following features:
- **User Registration**: Email/password signup
- **User Login**: Secure session management
- **JWT Tokens**: Automatic token generation and refresh
- **Session Persistence**: Maintains login state across browser sessions

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All tables have RLS policies that ensure:
- Users can only access their own data
- All new records are automatically tagged with the user's ID
- Database-level security prevents unauthorized access

### Required RLS Policies
```sql
-- Enable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE flock_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE egg_entries ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE expenses ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE feed_inventory ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE flock_events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies for each table
CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their own flock profiles" ON flock_profiles
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their own egg entries" ON egg_entries
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their own expenses" ON expenses
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their own feed inventory" ON feed_inventory
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their own flock events" ON flock_events
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

## Tables

### flock_profiles
**Purpose**: Store farm and flock information with detailed bird counts and metadata

**Schema**:
- `id` (UUID, Primary Key): Unique identifier for each flock profile
- `user_id` (UUID, NOT NULL): Foreign key to auth.users (Supabase Auth)
- `farm_name` (TEXT): Name of the farm (default: 'My Chicken Farm')
- `location` (TEXT): Farm location/address
- `flock_size` (INTEGER): Total number of birds in the flock

- `count` (INTEGER, NOT NULL): Number of eggs collected

**Security**:
- RLS policy filters entries by user_id
- Users can only see their own egg production data

### flock_events
**Purpose**: Track timeline events and milestones in the flock's lifecycle

**Schema**:
- `id` (UUID, Primary Key): Unique identifier for each event
- `flock_profile_id` (UUID, Foreign Key): References flock_profiles.id

**API Operations**:
- **Save**: POST creates new events, PUT updates existing events
- **Read**: Fetched with flock profile, ordered by date ascending
- **Delete**: DELETE removes events by ID

**Data Integrity**:
- Events are linked to flock profiles via foreign key
- Event types are constrained to predefined values
- Frontend generates UUIDs for new events, database returns actual IDs
- Events are sorted chronologically in the timeline

**Event Types**:
- `acquisition`: New birds acquired (üê£)
- `laying_start`: Hens started laying eggs (ü•ö)
- `broody`: Hens went broody (üêî)
- `hatching`: Eggs hatched (üê£)
- `other`: Other significant events (üìù)

### feed_inventory
**Purpose**: Track feed purchases, consumption, and inventory management

**Schema**:

- `created_at` (TIMESTAMP): Record creation timestamp
- `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP): Last update timestamp

**API Operations**:
- **Save**: Creates or updates feed inventory entries
- **Read**: Returns all entries ordered by opened_date descending

**Data Integrity**:
- All entries must have valid dates and quantities
- Price tracking for cost analysis
- Batch numbers for quality control tracking

### expenses

## Data Relationships

### Primary Relationships
- **flock_profiles ‚Üí flock_events**: One-to-many relationship
  - One flock profile can have multiple timeline events
  - Events are linked via `flock_profile_id` foreign key
  - Events are automatically loaded when fetching flock profile data

### Independent Tables
- **egg_entries**: Standalone daily production tracking
- **feed_inventory**: Standalone feed management
- **expenses**: Standalone financial tracking

### Data Flow
1. **Profile Setup**: User creates flock_profiles entry with basic farm information
2. **Timeline Events**: flock_events are created to track important milestones
3. **Daily Operations**: egg_entries track daily production independently
4. **Resource Management**: feed_inventory and expenses track costs and resources

## Data Validation Rules

### flock_profiles
- `farm_name`: Required, defaults to 'My Chicken Farm'
- `hens`, `roosters`, `chicks`, `brooding`: Non-negative integers, default 0
- `start_date`: Valid date format
- `flock_size`: Should match sum of individual bird counts

### flock_events
- `flock_profile_id`: Must reference existing flock_profiles.id
- `date`: Required, valid date format
- `type`: Must be one of: 'acquisition', 'laying_start', 'broody', 'hatching', 'other'
- `description`: Required, non-empty string
- `affected_birds`: Optional, non-negative integer

### egg_entries
- `date`: Required, unique per entry
- `count`: Required, non-negative integer

## Database Indexes and Performance

### Primary Keys (Automatic Indexes)
- All tables use UUID primary keys for optimal distribution
- UUIDs prevent conflicts in distributed environments

### Foreign Key Indexes
- `flock_events.flock_profile_id` ‚Üí `flock_profiles.id`

### Query Optimization
- Events are ordered by date for timeline display
- Egg entries ordered by date descending for recent-first display
- Expenses ordered by date descending for financial analysis

## API Endpoints and Operations

### Data Fetching
- **GET /api/getData**: Returns all data (profiles, events, eggs, feed, expenses)
- Normalizes database field names to frontend expectations
- Handles missing or null data gracefully

### Data Persistence
- **POST /api/saveFlockProfile**: Upsert flock profile data
- **POST /api/saveFlockEvents**: Create new timeline events
- **PUT /api/saveFlockEvents**: Update existing timeline events
- **DELETE /api/deleteFlockEvent**: Remove timeline events
- **POST /api/saveEggEntries**: Upsert egg production data
- **POST /api/saveFeedInventory**: Manage feed inventory
- **POST /api/saveExpenses**: Track financial expenses

### Error Handling
- UUID validation for foreign key relationships
- Proper HTTP status codes for different error types
- Detailed error messages for debugging
