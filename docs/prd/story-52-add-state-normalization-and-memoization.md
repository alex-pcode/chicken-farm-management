# Story 5.2: Add State Normalization and Memoization
As a developer,  
I want optimized state management,  
so that I can improve performance through reduced re-renders and better data access patterns.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Implement proper state normalization for complex data structures
2. Add memoization strategies to prevent unnecessary re-renders
3. Create selective subscription patterns for granular data access
4. Optimize context update patterns and dependency tracking

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Component render behavior maintains current functionality
- IV2: Data updates continue to propagate properly across components  
- IV3: Performance is improved or maintained with optimization changes
