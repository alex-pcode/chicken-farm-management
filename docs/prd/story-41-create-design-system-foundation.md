# Story 4.1: Create Design System Foundation
As a developer,  
I want foundational design system components,  
so that I can ensure consistent styling and behavior across the application.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Extract common styling patterns and create design tokens
2. Create foundational animation configuration library
3. Implement consistent color, spacing, and typography systems
4. Build base component library with common props and behaviors

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: All components maintain identical visual appearance
- IV2: Animations continue to work with same timing and effects
- IV3: Responsive behavior remains consistent across devices
