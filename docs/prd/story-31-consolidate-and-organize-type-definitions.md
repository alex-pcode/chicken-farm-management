# Story 3.1: Consolidate and Organize Type Definitions
As a developer,  
I want well-organized type definitions,  
so that I can easily find and use the correct types for different contexts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Reorganize types into clear database vs application type separation
2. Create consistent naming patterns for interfaces and types
3. Eliminate duplicate type definitions across files
4. Establish clear type organization structure

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: All components continue to compile without type errors
- IV2: Existing component interfaces remain functional
- IV3: IDE type checking and code completion work properly
