# Story 5.3: Optimize Data Fetching Patterns
As a developer,  
I want improved data fetching and caching,  
so that I can provide better user experience with faster data access and updates.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Improve caching strategies with smarter invalidation patterns
2. Implement optimistic updates for better perceived performance
3. Add proper loading states and error boundaries for data operations
4. Create efficient refresh patterns based on data staleness

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Data fetching maintains current reliability and error handling
- IV2: Loading states and user feedback continue to work as expected
- IV3: Cache invalidation preserves data consistency and freshness
