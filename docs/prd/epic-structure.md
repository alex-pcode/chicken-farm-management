# Epic Structure

### Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision:** Six coordinated epics addressing different architectural concerns with clear dependencies, designed for incremental implementation to minimize risk to existing system.

Based on analysis of the existing project, this enhancement should be structured as multiple coordinated epics because the codebase has grown to significant complexity (24 components, multiple contexts, extensive API patterns) requiring systematic architectural improvements across different domains (API layer, component design, types, UI, state management, organization).
