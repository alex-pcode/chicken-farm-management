# Story 1.3: Migrate Components to Consolidated API
As a developer,  
I want components to use the consolidated API service,  
so that I can eliminate duplicate code and improve maintainability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Remove duplicate saveToDatabase functions from all components
2. Update components to use new API service layer
3. Maintain identical component behavior and interfaces
4. Preserve all error handling and loading states

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: All data operations continue to work identically from user perspective
- IV2: Component interfaces remain unchanged for routing and parent components
- IV3: Error states and loading indicators function as before
