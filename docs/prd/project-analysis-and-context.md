# Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source:** IDE-based fresh analysis of current React/Vite/TypeScript/Supabase application

**Current Project State:** 
Chicken Manager is a functional poultry management application with egg tracking, feed cost management, CRM capabilities, and flock management. Recent additions include Feed Cost Calculator and Chicken Viability Calculator, indicating active development and feature growth.

### Documentation Analysis

**Available Documentation:**
- ✅ Tech Stack Documentation (React/Vite/TypeScript/Supabase)
- ✅ Project Brief with roadmap (docs/brief.md)
- ✅ API Architecture (Supabase integration)
- ❌ Coding Standards (informal patterns observed)
- ❌ Component Architecture Documentation
- ❌ Technical Debt Documentation

### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type:**
- ✅ Performance/Scalability Improvements
- ✅ Technology Stack Upgrade (architectural improvements)
- ✅ Bug Fix and Stability Improvements (maintainability)

**Enhancement Description:**
Comprehensive structural refactoring to transform the current working prototype into a maintainable, scalable codebase that supports the intelligent features roadmap outlined in docs/brief.md.

**Impact Assessment:**
- ✅ Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes)

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**
- Reduce component complexity from 500-1000+ lines to focused, single-responsibility components
- Eliminate code duplication through centralized API layer and shared UI components
- Establish consistent type system that prevents runtime errors and improves developer experience
- Optimize state management to reduce unnecessary re-renders and improve performance
- Create maintainable foundation for implementing intelligent features (performance alerts, insights dashboard, community features)

**Background Context:**
The application has grown organically with successful user adoption and feature requests. To implement the intelligent features outlined in docs/brief.md (timeline-based intelligence, performance alerts, community safety net), we need a solid architectural foundation. Current technical debt would make these features difficult to implement and maintain.
