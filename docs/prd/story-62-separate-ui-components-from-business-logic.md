# Story 6.2: Separate UI Components from Business Logic
As a developer,  
I want clear separation between different component types,  
so that I can quickly find and maintain different kinds of functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Move animation components to dedicated UI folder
2. Organize shared components by functionality (forms, layout, display)
3. Separate business logic components from presentation components
4. Create clear documentation for new organizational structure

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Component imports work correctly with new organization
- IV2: Animation and UI components maintain current functionality
- IV3: Business logic components continue to integrate properly
