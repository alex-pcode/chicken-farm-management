# Story 4.2: Build Reusable Form Components  
As a developer,  
I want consistent form components,  
so that I can maintain uniform user experience across different data entry workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Create shared input components with validation display
2. Build consistent form layouts and submission patterns
3. Implement shared form state management and error handling
4. Extract common form animation and transition patterns

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: All forms continue to work with identical behavior and styling
- IV2: Form validation and error states maintain current functionality
- IV3: Form submission and data handling remain unchanged
