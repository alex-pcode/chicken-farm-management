# Story 2.1: Extract Form Validation & Input Components
As a developer,  
I want reusable form components and validation logic,  
so that I can maintain consistency across different data entry forms.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Create shared form input components with consistent styling
2. Extract validation logic into reusable hooks or utilities
3. Implement shared form layout patterns used across components
4. Maintain existing form behavior and validation messages

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: All existing forms continue to work with same validation behavior
- IV2: Form submission and error handling maintain current functionality
- IV3: Visual appearance and animations remain identical
