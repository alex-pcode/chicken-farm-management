**FR4:** User experience and visual appearance must remain unchanged during structural improvements

**FR5:** API endpoints and authentication flows must continue working without interruption

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** Component sizes must be reduced by 40%+ while maintaining functionality through focused single-responsibility design

**NFR2:** Code duplication must be eliminated through shared API layer and UI component library

**NFR3:** Type safety must be improved with elimination of 'any' types and consistent interface usage

**NFR4:** Performance must be maintained or improved through optimized state management and component rendering

**NFR5:** Developer experience must be significantly improved through better code organization and documentation
