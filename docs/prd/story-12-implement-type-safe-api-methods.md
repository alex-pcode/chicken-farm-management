# Story 1.2: Implement Type-Safe API Methods
As a developer,  
I want properly typed API methods,  
so that I can catch errors at compile time and improve code reliability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Replace all 'any[]' parameters with proper TypeScript interfaces
2. Implement comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
3. Add proper return type definitions for all API methods
4. Include JSDoc documentation for API service methods

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: TypeScript compilation succeeds with improved type safety
- IV2: Existing API calls continue to work with new type definitions
- IV3: Error handling maintains current user experience while improving consistency
