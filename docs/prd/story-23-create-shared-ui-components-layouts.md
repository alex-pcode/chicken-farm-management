# Story 2.3: Create Shared UI Components & Layouts
As a developer,  
I want reusable UI components for common patterns,  
so that I can maintain visual consistency and reduce code duplication.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Extract common table and list rendering patterns
2. Create shared modal and dialog components
3. Implement reusable stat card and metric display components
4. Build shared pagination component used across multiple features

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: All UI components render identically to current implementation
- IV2: Interactive elements (buttons, modals, forms) maintain current behavior
- IV3: Responsive design and animations continue to work properly
