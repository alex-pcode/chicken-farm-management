# Story 6.1: Create Feature-Based Module Structure
As a developer,  
I want logically organized code structure,  
so that I can easily navigate and understand the project architecture.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Organize components into feature modules (flock, financial, crm, shared)
2. Create proper index exports for each module
3. Maintain backward compatibility through re-exports
4. Establish clear module boundaries and dependencies

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: All existing imports continue to work without modification
- IV2: Build process and deployment pipeline remain functional
- IV3: Development tools and IDE navigation work with new structure
