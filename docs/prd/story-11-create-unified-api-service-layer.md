# Story 1.1: Create Unified API Service Layer
As a developer,  
I want a centralized API service layer,  
so that I can maintain consistent patterns and reduce code duplication across components.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. New API service layer consolidates all data operations from authApiUtils.ts
2. Consistent error handling patterns implemented across all API calls
3. Authentication and token refresh logic centralized
4. Service layer provides clear separation between different data domains

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: All existing components continue to work with current data operations
- IV2: Authentication flows remain functional with centralized token handling
- IV3: Database operations maintain current performance and data integrity
