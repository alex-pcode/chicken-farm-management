# Story 2.2: Extract Data Management Hooks
As a developer,  
I want custom hooks that handle complex state logic,  
so that I can reduce component complexity and improve reusability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Create custom hooks for pagination logic (EggCounter, others)
2. Extract data fetching and caching patterns into reusable hooks
3. Implement hooks for form state management and validation
4. Reduce component useState calls by 50%+ through custom hooks

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Components maintain identical data handling behavior
- IV2: Loading states and error handling continue to work as expected
- IV3: Performance characteristics remain the same or improve
