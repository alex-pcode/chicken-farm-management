# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript  
**Frameworks:** React, Vite, Framer Motion  
**Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL with Row Level Security)  
**Infrastructure:** Vercel deployment, GitHub integration  
**External Dependencies:** Recharts, UUID, various React utilities

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy:** Maintain current Supabase client usage while consolidating into centralized API service layer

**API Integration Strategy:** Preserve existing endpoint structure while eliminating duplicate API call patterns across components

**Frontend Integration Strategy:** Maintain current React Router structure and component exports while refactoring internal implementations

**Testing Integration Strategy:** Ensure existing functionality works through manual testing and component verification

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach:** Organize components by feature domain (flock, financial, crm, shared) while maintaining current import patterns through re-exports

**Naming Conventions:** Maintain existing component names and interfaces while improving internal structure and type naming

**Coding Standards:** Establish consistent patterns for API calls, error handling, and component structure based on current best practices in codebase

**Documentation Standards:** Document architectural decisions and component responsibilities for future development

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration:** No changes to existing Vite build configuration and Vercel deployment process

**Deployment Strategy:** Incremental deployment with rollback capabilities, no breaking changes to production

**Monitoring and Logging:** Maintain current error handling patterns while improving consistency across components

**Configuration Management:** Preserve existing environment variable and Supabase configuration management

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks:** 
- Component refactoring breaking existing functionality
- Import path changes causing build failures
- State management changes affecting data synchronization

**Integration Risks:**
- API consolidation disrupting existing data flows
- Type system changes causing compilation errors  
- Shared component extraction affecting UI consistency

**Deployment Risks:**
- File reorganization causing deployment pipeline issues
- Performance regressions from architecture changes

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Incremental implementation with comprehensive testing at each step
- Maintain backward compatibility through type aliases and re-exports during transition
- Preserve existing component interfaces and behaviors throughout refactoring process
- Rollback plans defined for each epic in case of issues
