# Story 4.3: Develop Shared Layout Components
As a developer,  
I want reusable layout and display components,  
so that I can maintain consistent user interface patterns throughout the application.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Extract common card and container components
2. Create shared modal and dialog components with consistent behavior
3. Implement reusable table and list display components
4. Build shared pagination and navigation components

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: All UI layouts render identically to current implementation  
- IV2: Interactive components (modals, tables, pagination) maintain current functionality
- IV3: Component animations and transitions continue to work properly
