# LemonSqueezy Subscription Implementation - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- **Establish sustainable recurring revenue model** through $5/month subscriptions to fund ongoing development and infrastructure
- **Maintain user accessibility** by preserving core egg tracking functionality as free tier while monetizing comprehensive farm management features  
- **Achieve rapid market validation** with MVP launch within 6-8 weeks to test conversion rates and pricing assumptions
- **Create scalable subscription infrastructure** using LemonSqueezy integration that supports future growth and feature expansion
- **Deliver clear value proposition** with simple two-tier model that eliminates user confusion and decision paralysis

### Background Context

Our comprehensive poultry management application currently serves farmers with production tracking, expense management, customer relationship tools, and analytics as a completely free service. While this has driven user adoption, it creates an unsustainable business model without recurring revenue to support ongoing development, infrastructure scaling, or premium feature creation.

The agricultural technology market is rapidly evolving with increased digitization, and our current free-only model prevents us from competing with well-funded agricultural software companies. By implementing a freemium subscription model through LemonSqueezy, we can maintain barrier-free entry for basic egg tracking while monetizing the comprehensive farm management capabilities that provide clear business value to commercial operations.

## Requirements

### Functional

**FR1:** The application shall integrate with LemonSqueezy payment processing to handle subscription creation, updates, and cancellations through hosted checkout pages

**FR2:** The system shall implement binary feature gating where free tier users can access only EggCounter functionality while premium subscribers access all application features

**FR3:** The application shall process LemonSqueezy webhooks in real-time to update user subscription status in the Supabase database without manual intervention

**FR4:** The system shall provide a subscription management interface allowing users to view billing history, update payment methods, and cancel subscriptions through LemonSqueezy customer portal integration

**FR5:** The application shall display premium feature previews to free users with clear upgrade prompts and lock indicators on restricted functionality

**FR6:** The system shall maintain existing user data integrity during subscription implementation rollout, ensuring no data loss or access disruption for current users

**FR7:** The application shall validate subscription status at both UI component level and database RLS policy level to prevent unauthorized access to premium features

**FR8:** The system shall handle subscription lifecycle events (creation, renewal, cancellation, payment failure) automatically through webhook processing and user notification

### Non Functional

**NFR1:** Subscription status checks must not impact application performance with <100ms additional latency for premium feature authorization

**NFR2:** LemonSqueezy webhook processing must achieve 99.9% reliability with automatic retry mechanisms for failed webhook deliveries

**NFR3:** The subscription system must support international customers through LemonSqueezy's built-in tax compliance and currency conversion capabilities

**NFR4:** Feature gating implementation must be maintainable with single configuration point for premium feature definitions across the application

**NFR5:** The system must remain operational during LemonSqueezy service interruptions with graceful degradation and manual override capabilities for critical subscription status updates

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

**Seamless Value Discovery:** The subscription model should feel like a natural progression rather than a paywall. Free users experience core value through egg tracking while clearly understanding the comprehensive farm management capabilities available through premium upgrade. The interface maintains the familiar, agricultural-focused design while introducing subtle premium indicators that create desire without frustration.

**Trust and Transparency:** All subscription interactions (pricing, billing, features) must feel transparent and honest. Users should never feel surprised by charges, locked out unexpectedly, or confused about what they're getting. The $5/month value proposition should be immediately obvious through premium feature previews and clear capability demonstrations.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**Progressive Disclosure:** Free users see premium features in navigation with elegant lock icons and preview modes that demonstrate value without allowing full access. Upgrade prompts are contextual and helpful rather than aggressive or interruptive.

**One-Click Subscription:** Upgrade flow requires minimal steps - clicking premium feature triggers immediate LemonSqueezy checkout with clear return path to newly unlocked functionality.

**Self-Service Management:** All subscription operations (billing, cancellation, reactivation) handled through integrated LemonSqueezy customer portal to minimize support overhead.

### Core Screens and Views

**Subscription Status Dashboard:** Dedicated settings page showing current plan, billing history, feature comparison, and upgrade/downgrade options

**Premium Feature Lock States:** Consistent visual treatment across all gated features with preview capability and contextual upgrade messaging

**Checkout Success Flow:** Post-payment confirmation with immediate feature unlock and onboarding tour of newly available capabilities

**Billing Management Interface:** Integrated LemonSqueezy customer portal for payment method updates, invoice access, and subscription modifications

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

Subscription interface must meet WCAG AA standards with keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and color contrast compliance. Payment flows must be accessible to users with disabilities including clear error messaging and alternative input methods.

### Branding

Maintain existing agricultural aesthetic with earth tones and farm-focused imagery. Subscription elements should feel integrated rather than bolted-on, using consistent typography, color palette, and visual language from current application design.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Web application with responsive design optimized for desktop and mobile browsers. Subscription management must work seamlessly across devices with touch-friendly interfaces on mobile and efficient workflows on desktop.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Continue with existing structure - subscription features integrate within current codebase.

### Service Architecture
Serverless functions within monorepo for LemonSqueezy webhooks and subscription management.

### Testing Requirements
Unit + Integration testing including subscription flow validation and webhook processing tests.

### Additional Technical Assumptions
- LemonSqueezy webhooks provide reliable subscription event delivery
- Supabase RLS policies can efficiently handle subscription-based feature access
- React context can manage subscription state without performance impact
- Vercel serverless functions adequate for webhook processing load
