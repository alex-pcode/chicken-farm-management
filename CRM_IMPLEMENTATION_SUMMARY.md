# CRM Implementation Summary

## 🎉 Implementation Complete - July 15, 2025

Your **Minimal Egg Sales CRM** has been successfully implemented and is ready for production use!

## 📋 Quick Overview

### What It Does
- **Customer Management**: Track your egg customers with contact info and notes
- **Sales Recording**: Simple egg sales with automatic pricing calculation
- **Free Egg Tracking**: Record $0.00 sales for community giving and promotions
- **Analytics & Reports**: Revenue tracking, customer insights, and free egg statistics

### Key Design Decisions
